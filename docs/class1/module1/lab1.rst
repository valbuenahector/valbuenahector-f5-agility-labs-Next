Lab 1.1 - About BIG-IP Next
===========================

BIG-IP Next is F5's next generation BIG-IP software built to offer greater automation capabilities, scalability, and ease-of-use for organizations running applications on-premise, in the cloud, or out at the edge. At its core, it is still the same BIG-IP that F5 customers know and trust, simply designed and rearchitected for the future.

Declarative APIs are the foundation of BIG-IP Next's API-first design, making it faster and easier for DevOps, NetOps, and other BIG-IP reliant teams to manage and automate their deployments. A completely rearchitected and modernized software layer also provides the basis for significantly improved control plane scale, reduced cloud footprint, and rapid instance upgrades.
