Lab 1.2 - Accessing the Lab Environment
=======================================

This is a multi-step process that will involve:

1. Finding email invite to lab
2. Creating F5 account (If you don't have one already)
3. Setting up MFA for your F5 account (If you haven't already)
4. Signing into the lab environment

You should have received an email invitation to join the lab
