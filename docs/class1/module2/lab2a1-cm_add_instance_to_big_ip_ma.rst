Lab 2.1 - How to: Add a BIG-IP Next instance to BIG-IP Next Central Manager
===========================================================================

This document describes how to add a BIG-IP Next instance to BIG-IP Next Central Manager for centralized management and what happens to local BIG-IP Next instance users when you do that.

Overview
~~~~~~~~
When you add a BIG-IP Next instance to BIG-IP:were Next Central Manager, all users currently configured on that local BIG-IP Next instance are automatically disabled so management of the instance is done exclusively from BIG-IP Next Central Manager.

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Before you add an instance to BIG-IP Next Central Manager, please confirm BIG-IP Next instance 1 is running in the UDF deployment.

  .. image:: ./instance1-running.png

- IP Address

    BIG-IP Next Instance 1:

    .. code-block:: console

      10.1.1.7

- Credentials

	Username:

	.. code-block:: console

		admin

	Password:

	.. code-block:: console

		Welcome123!

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

#. Log in to BIG-IP Next Central Manager as admin. You'll arrive at the Central Manager "Home" page and then navigate to the workspace switcher at the top left next to the F5 logo and click **Infrastructure**.

#. At the top of the screen, click **+ Add**.

#. Type the IP address for BIG-IP Next instance 1 and click **Connect**. Ignore the option for creating a new instance. You must use port `5443`.

    IP Address:

    .. code-block:: console

      10.1.1.7

    .. image:: ./lab2_next_cm_add_instance_dialog.png
      :scale: 25%

#. For the Management Credentials, in the **Username** and **Password** fields, enter the username and password that were used to login to the BIG-IP Next Central Manager and click **Next**.

    Username:

    .. code-block:: console

      admin

    Password:

    .. code-block:: console

      Welcome123!

    .. image:: ./lab2_next_cm_login_to_instance.png
      :scale: 25%

#. Once you have authenticated to the instance, you'll see a dialog prompting you to supply new Management Credentials. We suggest accepting the pre-populated username (admin-cm) and re-using the same password that has been used so far in the lab. Enter the password twice (in the **Password** and **Confirm Password** fields). You'll use this username and password to manage the BIG-IP Next instance and click **Add Instance**.

    Username:

    .. code-block:: console

      admin-cm

    Password:

    .. code-block:: console

      Welcome123!

    .. image:: ./lab2_next_cm_add_instance_management_credentials.png
      :scale: 25%

#. You'll be asked to confirm Central Management of the instance. BIG-IP Next Central Manager removes all locally-configured users from the BIG-IP Next instance you are adding. If, for any reason, disablement of users on the local BIG-IP Next instance fails, adding the BIG-IP Next instance to BIG-IP Next Central Manager is halted and all users are re-enabled on the local BIG-IP Next instance. You should click **Add** at this confirmation dialog.

    .. image:: ./lab2_img08_central_management_confirmation.png

#. You'll then be presented with the fingerprint of the cert for the instance and to confirm this.

    .. image:: ./lab2_next_cm_confirm_instance_fingerprint.png

#. After completing this procedure, you'll now see a new instances in the **My Instances** list.

Result
~~~~~~
You can now manage this BIG-IP Next instance from BIG-IP Next Central Manager.
