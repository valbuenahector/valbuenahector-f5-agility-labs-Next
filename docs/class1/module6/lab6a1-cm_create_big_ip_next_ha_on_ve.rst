How to: Create a BIG-IP Next HA Instance on VE from BIG-IP Next Central Manager
===============================================================================

Overview
~~~~~~~~
A BIG-IP Next HA instance consists of an active and a standby node. Create a BIG-IP Next HA instance to safe-guard your applications and traffic in the event there is an issue with the provider the BIG-IP Next is installed on. In such an event, the active node in your BIG-IP Next HA instance will failover to the standby node with no disruption to current traffic or applications.

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Before you can create a BIG-IP Next HA instance, you must have two standalone instances already onboarded to BIG-IP Next Central Manager. Refer to `How to: Onboard BIG-IP Next (GUI) <../module2/lab2a1-cm_add_instance_to_big_ip_ma.html>`_ for details.

- Two standalone BIG-IP Next instances running the same software version in the same provider (VE) and in a healthy state.
- A license for the BIG-IP Next instance you want to designate as the active node.
- Between five and seven self IP addresses that are not assigned anywhere else in your network
- Traffic VLANS - One IP address for each BIG-IP Next instance, plus a floating IP address
- Control Plane HA VLAN - One IP address for each BIG-IP Next instance (by default, this VLAN will use two additional IP addresses on the management network, but you have the option to create a separate VLAN)
- Data Plane HA VLAN - One IP address for each BIG-IP Next instance

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~
#. Navigate back to the **Infrastructure** page of BIG-IP Next Central Manager that was used during module 2.
#. Add a second BIG-IP Next instance to your infrastructure (the second instance is at 10.1.1.8)

   .. image:: ./lab6_img01_add_second_instance.png
      :scale: 25%
#. Follow procedure that was used to onboard initial device with instance 2 (10.1.1.8). Upon completion you should have four total instances as shown in below screenshot.

   .. image:: ./lab6_next_cm_instances_list_4_instances.png
      :scale: 25%
#. Click the **Mode** link (the word "Standalone" under the "Mode" column) of the standalone BIG-IP Next instance (big-ip-next-01.f5demo.com) you want to become the active node in the BIG-IP Next HA instance.

   .. image:: ./lab6_next_cm_enable_ha_on_instance1.png
      :scale: 25%
#. The High Availability panel opens.
#. Click the **Enable HA** button.
#. The HA Nodes panel opens.
   The name and IP address for the BIG-IP Next instance that you selected displays.
   This will be the active node in the BIG-IP Next HA instance after itâ€™s created.
#. From the **Available Standby Instances** list, select the BIG-IP Next instance (big-ip-next-02.f5demo.com) you want to designate as the standby node in the BIG-IP Next HA instance, and click the **Next** button.

   .. image:: ./lab6_next_cm_add_ha_select_ha_node.png
      :scale: 25%
#. BIG-IP Next Central Manager displays only BIG-IP Next instances that meet the requirements to be a standby node. That is, only healthy BIG-IP Next instances running the same software version as the future active node on the same provider (VE).
#. From the **Control Plane VLAN** list, you'll need to create a new Control Plane VLAN for this BIG-IP Next HA instance by clicking the **Create VLAN** link.

   .. note::
      When creating a new VLAN, the name must be unique and no longer than 15 characters. Longer names cause issues if troubleshooting is required.

   .. image:: ./lab6_add_ha_vlan_config.png
      :scale: 25%

   Use the name "ctl-plane-vlan" for this and Tag "3999". The Network Interface selection is inoperative and can be left unchanged.

   VLAN Name:

   .. code-block:: console

      ctl-plane-vlan

   Tag:

   .. code-block:: console

      3999

      :scale: 25%

   Click **Done**

#. From the **Data Plane VLAN** list for this BIG-IP Next HA instance, you'll need to create a new Data Plane VLAN by clicking the **Create VLAN** link.

   .. image:: ./lab6_add_ha_vlan_config_needs_dataplane_vlan.png
      :scale: 25%

   Use the name "data-plane-vlan" for this and select Untagged Interface: "1.3"

   VLAN Name:

   .. code-block:: console

      data-plane-vlan

   Untagged Interface:

   .. code-block:: console

      1.3

   .. image:: ./lab6_add_ha_create_data_plane_vlan.png
      :scale: 25%

   Click **Done**

#. After you select the VLANs, click the **Next** button.

#. The HA Properties panel opens.
#. Enter the **HA Name** (example: ha1) for this high availability pair of nodes. This name should be unique for each pair managed by the Next Central Manager instance.

   Name:

   .. code-block:: console

      ha1

#. Enter the **HA Management (Floating) IP Address** (should be 10.1.1.9) for use when failing over to the standby node.

   HA Management (Floating) IP Address:

   .. code-block:: console

      10.1.1.9

#. Enter the **Control Plane** and **Data Plane IP** addresses that the active and standby nodes use for communication with each other. (See screenshot for suggested IP addresses)
   Address for big-ip-next-01.f5demo.com: control plane: 10.1.1.77/24; data plane: 10.1.40.7/24 and big-ip-next-02.f5demo.com: control plane: 10.1.1.88/24; data plane: 10.1.40.8/24

   big-ip-next-01 control plane IP:

   .. code-block:: console

      10.1.1.77/24

   big-ip-next-01 data plane IP:

   .. code-block:: console

      10.1.40.7/24

   big-ip-next-02 control plane IP:

   .. code-block:: console

      10.1.1.88/24

   big-ip-next-02 data plane IP:

   .. code-block:: console

      10.1.40.8/24

#. The subnet for the data plane address should not be shared with either management or control plane addresses. Management and control plane can share a common subnet or they can each use unique subnets. The addresses for the nodes in an HA pair must use corresponding subnets for management, control plane and data plane.

#. Click **Next**.

#. The Traffic VLANs panel opens and displays the VLANs you specified for traffic.

   .. image:: ./lab6_add_ha_traffic_vlans_unconfigured.png
      :scale: 25%

#. You can have only one IP address for each active and standby node, but you can add additional floating IP addresses by clicking on the VLAN name.
#. Click each VLAN to open a panel to add the respective Active, Standby, and Floating IP addresses. You may need to reassign the IP address that shows up when you first enter the page from a Floating Self-IP to the Active Self-IP. You will need to click the "+" next to the address twice to add two more address fields (for the standby node and floating IP addresses).

   Click **Yes, Deploy**

   It may take several minutes for the HA Deployment process to complete

#. Assuming a successful deployment, you'll see the properties of the HA instance you just created.

   .. image:: ./lab6_ha_instance_upgrade.png

#. Click **Exit** and you'll be returned to your My Instances list and you'll see that you now have an instance of type HA under the "Mode" column.

Result
~~~~~~
BIG-IP Next Central Manager converts the standalone BIG-IP Next instance to a BIG-IP Next HA instance.
