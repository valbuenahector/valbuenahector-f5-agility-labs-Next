How to: Manage applications using BIG-IP Next Central Manager and FAST templates
================================================================================

Summary
=======
Use this procedure to create, modify, or delete applications using templates on the BIG-IP Next Central Manager. For more information about application observability after the application is deployed and receiving traffic, see `Overview: Application Observability <cm_application_observability_overview.html>`_.

For more information about application observability once it is deployed and receiving traffic, see `Overview: Application Observability <cm_application_observability_overview.html>`_.

What role do templates play in deploying an application?
========================================================

When you deploy an application, you use a template that defines the parameters and values you want to specify for that application. BIG-IP Next Central Manager includes a set of default templates that are designed for a variety of use cases. These templates are not considered to be ready for production use; instead, they are intended as a place to start. To use these templates, choose one that includes definitions for most of the application objects you want to deploy and then modify a copy of that template so that it exactly defines the application you want to deploy. For details on how to make a copy of a template, refer to `Manage FAST templates <cm_manage_fast_templates>`_.

One key thing to understand about what makes FAST templates so powerful is their ability to use customizable parameters to define an application. When you create a template that uses this feature, you replace static, hard coded parameters with  variables that you fill in when you use this template to deploy an application.

For more information on FAST templates, refer to `F5 Application Services Templates <https://clouddocs.f5.com/products/extensions/f5-appsvcs-templates/latest/>`_.

For a list of FAST templates on Central Manager, see the `Template list <#fast-templates-on-central-manager>`_.

Prerequisites
=============

* Before you can create an application, you need to decide which template you’re going to use. There are three options:

  * Select an existing template and revise it so it defines the application you want to create.
  * Clone an existing template and revise it so it defines the application you want to create.
  * Create a new template that defines the application you want to create.

    For details on how to work with templates, refer to `Manage FAST templates <cm_manage_fast_templates>`_.

* Parameter details (for example, server names or addresses, pool names, and pool member addresses or names) that are required by the application template you plan to use for this application.
* If you intend to attach a certificate to your application, you need to know the name of the certificate you plan to use. For details about managing certificates and keys, refer to: `How to: Manage Instance Certificates and Keys using BIG-IP Next Central Manager <cm_instance_certificate_and_key_management>`_.
* The IP address of the BIG-IP Next instance you plan to deploy the application to.

---------------------
You can use either the user interface (UI) or the application programming interface (API) to create an application.


Using the BIG-IP Next Central Manager UI
----------------------------------------

Use this procedure to deploy a new application to a managed BIG-IP Next instance from the UI.
>**Note**: The tabs and fields that display on the Create Application screen are determined by the template you choose for the application. Some templates that are included with BIG-IP Next Central Manager include on/off switches that you can use to determine whether specific fields display or not.

#. Log in to BIG-IP Next Central Manager as admin, click the Workspace icon next to the F5 logo, and then click **Applications**.
#. If this is the first application you are adding to BIG-IP Next Central Manager, click **Start Adding Apps**. Otherwise, at the top of the screen, click **Add Application**.
#. Under Add Application, select **Create**.
#. Under Create Application, For **Application Template** select the template you want to use for this application, and then click **Start Creating**.

   The Properties tab for the Create Application screen opens.
#. For the **Location**, select the BIG-IP Next instance on which you want to deploy this application.
#. Type an **Application Name** for this application.
#. Type or select values (as appropriate) for the remaining parameters on this tab and click **Next**.
#. Specify values for the fields on the remaining tabs (use **Next** and **Back** to navigate) until you get to the Summary tab.
#. On the Summary tab, under Validate Deployment, click **Validate**.

   BIG-IP Next Central Manager performs a test deployment of your application to test the validity of the specified parameter values.
#. If the test deployment reveals any issues, resolve them and repeat the previous step.
#. When the test deployment is completely valid, click **Deploy**.
   BIG-IP Next Central Manager deploys the application.


Using the BIG-IP Next Central Manager API
-----------------------------------------
Use this procedure to deploy a new application to a managed BIG-IP Next instance using the BIG-IP Next Central Manager API.

#. Authenticate with the BIG-IP Next Central Manager API. For details refer to `How to: Authenticate with the BIG-IP Next Central Manager API <../use_cm/cm_api_auth.html>`_.

#. Create the application by sending a Post to the ``/mgmt/shared/fast/applications`` endpoint.

   ``POST https://<big-ip_next_cm_mgmt_ip>/mgmt/shared/fast/applications``

   For the API body, use the following, substituting values appropriate for the application you want to create.

   .. code-block:: json

    {
      "name": "Policy-Examples/HTTP-Load-Balancing-Service",
      "parameters": {
        "application_name": "basic-app1",
