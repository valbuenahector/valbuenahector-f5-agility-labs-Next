===================================
Overview: Application observability
===================================

Application observability allows you to measure the current state of your application endpoints based on the data metrics generated, whether by traffic or by the
communication between a BIG-IP Next instance and the application server.

Observability helps you to detect and analyze the significance of events by providing visibility into the traffic, connection patterns, security (if applicable), and
overall health of your endpoint.

How to access application data metrics
======================================

To view the details each application endpoint, go to: Applications > My Apps > **App Name** >  Endpoints (Pool Members) > **Endpoint Name**

The data metrics provide traffic insights from the past hour to your endpoint.
