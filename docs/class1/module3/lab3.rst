Lab 3.3 - Customizing a Template
================================

In this exercise we will modify our previous HTTPS-Load-Balancing-Service template to perform TLS re-encryption to the backend server.

* Change the pool member monitor from http to https
* Change the pool member port from 8080 to 8443
* Enable TLS encryption between the BIG-IP Next instance and the backend pool members

3.3.1 - Clone the Template
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a template has been used to deploy an application it will enter a "Published" state.  This makes the template a read-only object.  To make edits to the template you can either remove any applications that are using the template to revert it into "Draft" mode, or clone the template.  In this lab exercise we will clone the template.

.. note:: The "http" app is shipped with Central Manager.  We have loaded a custom HTTPS-Load-Balancing-Service application into this lab environment.  It is a modified version of the provided "http" template.

#. Under the Applications menu click on **Application Templates**
#. Select the checkbox next to the **HTTPS-Load-Balancing-Service** template
#. Click on the **Clone** button

#. Click on **Save**

3.3.2 - Modify the Cloned Template
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now that you have cloned the template, you will make the following changes:

* Change virtual server port from 443 to 8443 (to avoid port conflicts in the lab environment)
* Change the pool member monitor from http to https
* Enable TLS re-encryption to the backend pool member

#. Click on **clone_HTTPS-Load-Balancing-Service** and then click on the **Template** tab

#. Search for "pools:"  (CTRL-F in your browser or scroll ~50% of the page)  and change the default to use an https monitor and connect on port 8443. The completed change should look like this:

    .. code-block:: yaml

        pools: # Do not remove and do not change the property name. This is used to take pools information
            type: array
            default:
            -  {"loadBalancingMode": "round-robin","monitorType": ["https"],"poolName": "my_pool","servicePort": 8443}

#. Next, search for "enable_TLS_Server:" and change the default to "true". The stanza will begin with “enable_TLS_Server:” and look like the following once you have changed the value to true:

    .. code-block:: yaml

        enable_TLS_Server:
          title: Enable Server-side TLS
          description: Enable TLS to encrypt server-side connections.
          type: boolean
          default: true

#. Click on **Save**

3.3.3 - Verify the Cloned Template
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Next we will verify that your changes are present in the cloned template.

#. Under Applications go back to **My Application Services** and click on **+ Add Application**
#. Enter the Application Service name of "https-re-encrypt"
#. Select **From Template**
#. Click **Select Template**
#. In the flyout window, under Application Template, select **clone_HTTPS-Load-Balancing-Service** template
#. Click on **Start Creating**

#. Click on the **Pools** tab and verify that the monitor is now "https" and the service port is "8443"

    .. image:: cloned-pools.png
        :scale: 75%

#. Click on **Cancel & Exit**
#. Select the "https-re-encrypt" Application and select **Delete** under **Actions**

.. note:: If you run into any issues modifying your template, you can delete the "https-re-encrypt" application to make the template editable again.
