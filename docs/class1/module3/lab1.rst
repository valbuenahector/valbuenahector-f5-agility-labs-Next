Lab 3.1 - Deploy and operate Applications
=========================================

This section of the lab will utilize the "Applications" section of BIG-IP Next Central Manager.

When creating an application service, it happens in two steps.

Step 1:
Step 1:

Start by selecting a template, which will determine what type of features you will need (i.e. HTTPS, WAF, etc...). Some templates can be built to allow you to toggle features on/off (the template that ships with Central Manager includes the ability to toggle on/off WAF, iRules, etc...).

Once you have selected your template, you will need to define the name of your virtual server (destination of where you want your clients to connect) and information about the pools (backend servers).  This includes information such as the port numbers that should be used.

Step 2:

After you have defined the properties for your application, you will need to select the location of where you would like to deploy your applications.  You will then be prompted for the IP addresses for that specific location.

    You will see the default Application Service Properties for this template (these have been pre-populated by the template; in a later lab you will need to fill these in)

    Click on the edit icon next to "HTTPS" to view further details of the HTTPS configuration

#. Protocols and Profiles

    Here you can see the TLS options, click on "Add" under "No Client-Side TLS"

#. Virtual Address

    You can now enter your Virtual Address.  Use the IP Address "10.1.10.200"

    .. image:: deploy-to-virtual-address.png

    Then click on the down arrow next to "members" to open the Pool Members screen

#. Pool Members

    Click on the **+ Pool Members** to add pool members

    .. image:: deploy-to-pool-members-add-row.png

    Use the following values to add two rows

    =========================== ==========================
    Name                        IP Address
    --------------------------- --------------------------
    node1                       10.1.20.100
    --------------------------- --------------------------
    node2                       10.1.20.101

    Then click on **Save**

#. Validate

    You can now validate your changes before deploying them.

    Click on **Validate All**

    .. image:: deploy-to-validate-all.png

    After it completes click on **View Results**

    .. image:: deploy-to-validate-all-view-results.png
      :scale: 75%

    You can inspect the AS3 declaration that will be deployed to your BIG-IP Next instance.

    .. image:: deploy-to-validation-results.png

    Click on **Exit** to leave the preview of the AS3 declaration

#. Deploy Changes

    You are now ready to deploy your application to the desired location.

    Click on **Deploy Changes**

    .. image:: deploy-to-deploy-changes.png

#. Confirm that you would like to deploy

    You will be prompted to confirm, click on **Yes, Deploy**

    .. image:: deploy-to-confirmation.png

#. Within your UDF Deployment, go to the **Firefox** access method that is under the **Ubuntu Jump Host**

    This will open an embedded Firefox browser session that is running inside the lab environment.

    .. image:: access-method-firefox.png

#. Inside the Firefox browser session go to https://www.example.com
